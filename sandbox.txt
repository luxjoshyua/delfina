Starting build
1. Download build, run 
2. Check out new branch, named according to feature working on, never push straight to master
3. Run $ theme watch to start the development server; note it doesn't sync automatically like webpack

 Steps for deploying pages
 1. Checkout branch <whatever feature being worked on>
 2. Duplicate theme on app
 3. Change theme id in config to duplicated theme id
 4. Code
 5. Merge with master 
 6. Check theme still works
 7. Swap theme id to production id <main id>


Note: will never be working on the live delfina theme in Shopify, it's live meaning changes reflect immediately



Basic thoughts on approach
1. collection template (temples/collection.collection-team.liquid) is the theme for the team stores
2. get collection info from page https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/objects/collection#
3. work out how to add a few theme settings within web app at collections section - https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/development/sections#settings
4. checkout cannot be customized because we are not on SHOPIFY PLUS plan (?) so approach 
maybe should be user can add anything to cart, but once it is ordered we change the address of anything
from a team shop to the team address. 


5. ? maybe add a custom page page.team-shop.liquid for a list of stores available.
