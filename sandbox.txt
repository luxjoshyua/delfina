Starting build
1. Download build, run 
2. Check out new branch, named according to feature working on, never push straight to master
3. Run $ theme watch to start the development server; note it doesn't sync automatically like webpack

 Steps for deploying pages
 1. Checkout branch <whatever feature being worked on>
 2. Duplicate theme on app
 3. Change theme id in config to duplicated theme id
 4. Code
 5. Merge with master 
 6. Check theme still works
 7. Swap theme id to production id <main id>


Note: will never be working on the live delfina theme in Shopify, it's live meaning changes reflect immediately
